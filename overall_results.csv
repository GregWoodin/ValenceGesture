political action conference...or c-pac. hours after the announcment- yiannopoulos also lost his book deal. his publishers have cancelled the june release of his book entitled ""dangerous."" it all

nausea and spur the appetites of people undergoing chemotherapy. but the drug's growing popularity is bringing to light an unwanted side effect for a small number of heavy users. kron4's maureen kelly takes an in-depth look at this newly discovered syndrome. 31:11 it's the most excruciating nausea that you could possibly steve ellias of grass valley is decribing the symptoms he'd endured on and off for more than three decades..that he now believes was the result of his past chronic pot habit. 51:06 usually i would smoke anywhere from 10-15 times a day i was a pretty heavy smokerthis is a picture of steve from around the time the medical problem first started cropping up. imagine it's like that point when you have the flu and you know that you are going to be sick, but imagine getting stuck there for hours days and sometimes even weeks and nothing will relieve that nausea it's almost enough to make you think you will go out of your mind, such terrible nausea√°√°√°√°√°sometimes the bouts would be so serious he'd end up in the er32: at one point i lost 40 lbs in 10 days, that's how dramatic it was, i could not keep water down, not to be dramatic but i showed up at the hospital and i was within hours of kidney failure is what the doctor told me, so this can be an actual lifethreatening situation√° but for much of his lifehis condition was a mysterydocto rs sometimes suggesting that his illness was all in his head.35:08 literally dozens of doctors looked at me, and i've had extensive medical tests√° but at his last trip to the er a nurse showed him an article about a 2004 medical study of something called cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome or chs. which linked cyclical vomiting with heavy cannabis use.29:46 as soon as i read it knew that it was me and i almost teared up because after 35 years of suffering i could not believe that i had finally found a diagnosisi get another chance√° steve says it wasn't so much the study's link between pot smoking and excessive vomiting.but the identification of the one thing that commonly brings patients who suffer from chs relief.nats..immersion in hot water...by way of a hot shower or a bath.42:09 i would literally spend 2-3 weeks immersed in hot water 24 hours a day //within minutes of getting out of my hot water i would get excruciating nauseas and i'd have to rush back in and immerse myself and wasn't total relief but it was enough to rid me of that feeling like im gonna just die if i don't do something 14:11 i see a lot of this√°√°√°√°dr. linda nguyen is a gastroenterologist at stanford health care. she says the legal and political issues around marijuana means there haven't been many studies of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome06:59 no one knows why the hot shower can help with symptoms and the hotter the baths they hotter shower, the better they feel, 07:11 there have been reports that patients have actually scalded themselves because they needed it at such hot tempertures09:05 there are some hypothesis or therories as to why this occurs their might be a build up of the thc in the brain where it changes some of the thermal sensorsshe says the syndrome is not common among chronic pot user..and it's unknown why some end up developing chs, and other's don't.08:43 individuals who get this tend to be younger when they start and have been using marijuana for a long time, men more than women for some reason54:55 there's no lab test to diagnose it so it's hard to tell how many cases there are dr. kai li says she's seen a few of these cases turn up in the er at san francisco general.she says the diagnosis takes those affected patients by surprise.53:50 they think of marijuana primarily as a medication that will prevent nausea, so when they start to get a lot of vomiting, they actually smoke more because they think they are treating their symtoms and it acutally makes the symtoms worseright now there is only one known cure put down the pipe.56:32 the only real recommendation is that people stop smoking and they completely stop smoking because anytime they start smoking again they are going to be at risk again36:46 i went a year with none and then i tried a little bit and right away the symptoms came backnats steve ellias says he no longer has problems keeping down food.and he's now back to living a normal life.i haven't touched it since and i won't touch it again because for some of us it's poison, not for the average smoker but for those of us with chs this is poison√°√°√°he says he doesn't miss smoking pot anymore.he's just grateful to have another chance to be healthy. maureen kelly kron4 news. new at ten:a craigslist ad for a roommate is making national headlines... take a look -- among the house rules: no alcohol, pets or meat

the more dysfunctional teams in the nba, continues to amaze and gave away its franchise player. demarcus cousins...going from sacramento to new orleans... and forms what could be the most dominant frontcourt in the league as boogie now teams up with young superstar anthony davis. the immediate analysis is the kings lost out in this deal...by acquiring buddy hield, a couple of other players and a 1st-and-2nd round draft pick in return. many are wondering why the team didn't wait until thursday's trade deadline to make a deal and possibly raise √°cousins stock. earlier today, general manager vlade divac said he had to move quickly because he turned down a better offer two days ago.. in that same media session, divac consistently mentioned the importance of 'changing the culture,' which could be a veiled reference to cousins' volatile behavior. while there are questions about his demeanor, there's no doubting the love he had for the city. here's some video from tonight of boogie getting emotional...when talking about leaving sacramento. what a player does in his free time is his business, but-- you can't blame the raiders coaching staff for being a little stressed while
